                <strong>GRANT CULWELL</strong> moved from Dallas to Los Angeles in 2005 and attended the Los Angeles Film School. After graduation, Grant began working as a freelance crew member in various roles but found that he was always drawn to the camera. In 2007, Grant took the Tiffen 2 Day Steadicam Workshop and got the steadicam bug. That same year he began purchasing equipment and marketing himself as a steadciam operator. In 2008, Grant attended Tiffenâ€™s week long steadicam course taught by industry veterans Jerry Holway, Peter Abraham, and Chris Fawcett.
